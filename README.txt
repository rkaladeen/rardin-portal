RARDIN PORTAL

The Rardin Portal is a project inspired by my career with the franchisee restuarant chain management company. I have work a variety of positions in both business operations and later in technology support. After using numerous applications and tools to manage service operations, I came up with the idea to develop and implement a central portal that would host all the applications used in departments. The portal would also provide customized solutions that would enable the company to drop expensive contracts with Saas vendors, and even offer simipler solutions that would meet very specific business requirements. 

Additionally, I plan to expland this project with a more generic use case, I will be utilizing many of the various concepts I have learned on OOP through the Coding Dojo, and building detailed ERDs and design plans and documentations. All of which are concept I learned while enrolled at UMBC.

In conclusion, the purpose of this project is to consolidate all that I have been learning over the past 5 years and to explore advance functionality of the Django framework and CSS libraries, all in conjunction with styles and techniques of asynchronous programming principles of AJAX.
